# 👋 About Me

I’m Ramses, a cybersecurity student with a strong focus on both red and blue team techniques. I’m building my technical portfolio through real-world labs, offensive/defensive research, and self-driven projects.

- 🎓 Currently studying Cybersecurity (Associate Degree)
- 🧠 Learning full-spectrum defense: from pentesting to SIEM detection
- 🛡️ Focused on building a professional portfolio to land a security internship in Switzerland

This blog documents my learning journey, technical deep dives, and reflections on practical skills development.
