excerpt: "Created a command-line password generator in Python that supports multiple options like length, character types, file saving, and clipboard export. Here's a breakdown of the code, key takeaways, and ideas for future development."

Creating secure passwords is a fundamental part of cybersecurity, but most online generators donâ€™t offer much flexibility or transparency. So I decided to build my own command-line password generator using Python.

The goal was to develop something functional, customizable, and secureâ€”a utility I could actually use in daily tasks or build upon in future projects. I also wanted to sharpen my skills in Python scripting, CLI development, and simple automation.

## Features

The script supports a wide range of options:

- Generate multiple passwords at once  
- Customizable length for each password  
- Include or exclude uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols  
- Automatically save results to a timestamped `.txt` file  
- Optional clipboard copying (requires `pyperclip`)  
- `--no-save` flag to skip writing to file  

---

## Example Usage

```bash
python password_generator.py -n 5 -l 20 --copy
```
This command generates 5 passwords, each 20 characters long, and copies them to your clipboard (if pyperclip is installed). The passwords are also saved to a file like:

Setup
You only need Python 3 to run the script. To enable clipboard functionality:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyperclip

Behind the Script
Key components:
Uses argparse for command-line argument parsing

Character pools from string module (ascii_uppercase, digits, etc.)

Random generation using random.choice()

Input validation (length â‰¥ 4, at least one character type selected)

Timestamps output for file traceability

Clipboard export with optional pyperclip support

What I Learned
How to structure Python CLI tools using argparse

How to support optional third-party libraries gracefully

Timestamp-based file naming for traceability and automation

Best practices in defensive scripting and user feedback

Importance of small tools in building a security-focused workflow

Even a small, well-designed script like this can provide real-world utility and become a foundational building block in a cybersecurity toolkit.
