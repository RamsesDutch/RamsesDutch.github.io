excerpt: "Created a command-line password generator in Python that supports multiple options like length, character types, file saving, and clipboard export. Here's a breakdown of the code and my key takeaways."

Creating secure passwords is a fundamental part of cybersecurity, but most online generators don’t offer much flexibility or transparency. So I decided to build my own command-line password generator using Python.

The goal was to develop something functional, customizable, and secure—a utility I could actually use in daily tasks or build upon in future projects. I also wanted to sharpen my skills in Python scripting, CLI development, and simple automation.

## Features

The script supports a wide range of options:

- Generate multiple passwords at once
- Customizable length for each password
- Include or exclude uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
- Automatically save results to a timestamped `.txt` file
- Optional clipboard copying (requires `pyperclip`)
- `--no-save` flag to skip writing to file

---

## Example Usage

```bash
python password_generator.py -n 5 -l 20 --copy
```
This command generates 5 passwords, each 20 characters long, and copies them to your clipboard (if pyperclip is installed). The passwords are also saved to a file like:

passwords_20250718_144233.txt
Suggested Screenshot: Terminal showing the command and generated passwords.

Setup
You only need Python 3 to run the script. To enable clipboard functionality:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyperclip

Behind the Script
Key components of the code:

Uses argparse to handle command-line arguments for flexibility

Randomly generates passwords using random.choice() and character pools from the string module

Automatically saves passwords to a timestamped text file

Includes optional clipboard support using pyperclip

Performs input validation (e.g., minimum password length, character selection)

What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen:

Python CLI development and modular scripting

Working with optional third-party dependencies

Timestamp-based file naming for traceability

Writing user-friendly error messages and help menus

Developing utilities with real-world use in cybersecurity

It's a small tool, but highly practical—especially when automating secure workflows or building a personal toolkit.

Future Improvements
Here are some features I’d like to explore next:

Password entropy scoring

CSV or JSON output options

Packaging for pip or PyPI

Converting it into a Flask API or GUI (e.g., with Tkinter or Electron)

Final Thoughts
This project was a great opportunity to combine core cybersecurity principles with practical scripting. Developing tools like this not only helps streamline secure workflows, but also showcases technical initiative—something that's key in the cybersecurity field.
