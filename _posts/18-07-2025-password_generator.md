excerpt: "Created a command-line password generator in Python that supports multiple options like length, character types, file saving, and clipboard export. Here's a breakdown of the code and my key takeaways."

Creating secure passwords is a fundamental part of cybersecurity, but most online generators don’t offer much flexibility or transparency. So I decided to build my own **CLI-based password generator** using Python.

The goal was to develop something **functional, customizable, and secure**—a utility I could actually use in day-to-day tasks or build upon in future projects. I also wanted to deepen my experience with Python scripting, CLI tools, and simple automation.

## 🔧 Features

The script offers a range of configurable options:

- ✅ Generate multiple passwords at once (e.g., 5, 10, or more)
- 📏 Customizable length for each password
- 🔐 Toggle inclusion of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols
- 💾 Automatically saves results to a timestamped `.txt` file
- 📋 Optionally copies the output to your clipboard (if `pyperclip` is installed)
- 🚫 Use `--no-save` to skip writing to a file

---

## 🎯 Example Usage

```bash
python password_generator.py -n 5 -l 20 --copy
```
This command generates 5 passwords, each 20 characters long, and copies them to your clipboard for quick use. By default, the script also saves the passwords to a file like passwords_20250718_144233.txt.

📸 Screenshot suggestion: Show the terminal command and printed results.

🧪 Setup
You only need Python 3 to run the script. To enable clipboard functionality, install pyperclip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pyperclip
📸 Screenshot suggestion: Show pip install pyperclip in the terminal.

🧠 Behind the Script
The core logic includes:

Argument parsing with argparse for CLI flexibility

Random password generation using random.choice() and character pools from the string module

File writing with timestamp-based filenames for traceability

Clipboard copying using pyperclip (if available)

The script also includes validation to prevent insecure configurations (e.g., password length too short, or no character types selected).

🔍 What I Learned
This project helped me practice:

Building modular, CLI-based Python tools

Structuring scripts to be easy to maintain and extend

Handling optional dependencies like clipboard support

Using timestamps for traceable file exports

Writing user-friendly error messages and help documentation

It’s a small but practical tool that reflects real-world use cases in personal security and automation workflows.

🧩 Future Improvements
Some next steps I’m considering:

Adding password entropy scoring

Supporting CSV or JSON export formats

Packaging it for pip install or turning it into a Flask app

Building a GUI with Tkinter or Electron

🧠 Final Thoughts
This project was a great way to combine Python scripting with cybersecurity fundamentals. Tools like this are simple, but highly relevant—especially when you're building a toolkit for secure workflows or developing a cybersecurity portfolio.
